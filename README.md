This application is a **responsive player analytics dashboard** designed to demonstrate modern frontend capabilities in the sports-tech domain. It simulates an interface where coaches can monitor player stats, view AI-generated insights, and analyze training session history.

I built this project to showcase my proficiency with the **Next.js App Router**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**, directly aligning with the tech stack requirements at **we.train.football**.
